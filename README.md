# WiiUFtpServer
A new FTP server for the Wii-U that fix files injection, display files timestamps correctly and much more faster than others.

It **fixes remaining files injection failures** when using ftp-everywhere.

Few games such as WWHD check the save files'rights and refuse to import them if permissions rights are not set using IOSUHAX_FSA_ChangeMode.

Speeds compared to FTP-everywhere : ((Wii-U Ethernet Adapter and laptop connected with WIFI)

**NOTES :**


- The server does not implement the [MTDM](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Enable-the-MDTM-command-to-preserve-the-original-time-stamp-of-uploaded-files?language=en_US) function (and so does not preserves files timestamps) but now displays the correct dates :

</p>

- The FTP method used is I/O multiplexing (single threaded non-blocking I/O) like the orginal software (ftpii).

- This FTP server is limited to 1 unique client (more safer) and one unqiue transfer slot for up/download (fix deconnexion issues)

- Use Ethernet connection if possible (below : Wii-U with Ethernet adapter & laptop connected with Ethernet 5)
