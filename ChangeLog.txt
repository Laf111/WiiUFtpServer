======================================================================================================

FTP server based on libWUT and libIOSUHAX. 
It fixes remaining files injection failures when using ftp-everywhere (such as saves for WWHD*).

The build process creates : HBL app + WUP package (to install it on the Wii-U menu as a channel)

* Few games such as WWHD check the save files'rights and refuse to import them if permissions rights are not set using IOSUHAX_FSA_ChangeMode.

======================================================================================================
BUILD : (i used Windows)

Install devkitPro (in DEVKITPRO_PATH) and download the libIOSUHAX from YaWut repository.

Launch "msys2\msys2_shell.bat" 
Get WUT with command : pacman -Syu devkitPPC wut-tools wut

Build libIOSUHAX, create $DEVKITPRO_PATH/libiosuhax folder and put lib and include folders in.

- export DEVKITPRO=$DEVKITPRO_PATH

- cd WiiUFtpServer

- ./build.sh

It creates a HBL App under \_sdCard\wiiu\apps\WiiUFtpServer

To create the channel version (HBC), use "toWUP\createChannel.bat"

Then copy the \_sdCard content to your SD card.

    > Increase bandwith by 30%
    > Set files timestamp to OStime instead of J1970
  
2021/04/22 V1-1 : 
    > Change rights on the files received : fix files injection (saves for WWD for example)
    > Increase bandwith by 50%

2021/04/22 V1-2 : 
    > Try to fix timestamps with a date offset
      time_t seems to be a long double timestamp with micro-seconds based on epoch 1980
      The following code return "floating-point type"
        if ((time_t)-1 > 0) {
            // time_t is an unsigned type
        }
        else if ((time_t)1 / 2 > 0) {
            // time_t is a signed integer type
        }
        else {
            // time_t is a floating-point type (I've never seen this)
        }

2021/05/28 V3-2 : Enhance display log on server side, multithreading just for the fun... (bottleneck is on network socket not on CPU), 
                  a real progress should be a SSL server using lib curl (should be more efficient than using select() for FTP sockets as 
                  the code is already asynchronous I/O)

    > create a gitHub branch for the HBL version based on first version of dynamic_libs that gives a greater socket bandwith 
      almost 30% more than using the WUT API.
      This version will replace the HBL version in the future release (channel version is still based on libWUT)

2021/07/23 V4-3 :    
    > put the 2 codes in the same project :
        - version using dynamic libs for HBL (best bandwith ~40% faster than WUT version)
        - building channel using the WUT version
    > rename WUP package name to WiiuFtpServer

        +10% DL speed compare to V6
        +70% UL speed (UL is now faster than DL)    
    > enhance robustness (fix errors -99, -100, ENOMEM, ECONABORTED...). thanks Masana@GBATemp for testing!
    > add a NAND backup/restore process :
        - when you choose to mount NAND paths, if no backup is found in WiiuFtpServer app folder on the SDcard,
          create a partial (2MB) or a FULL system files NAND backup (500MB free on SD card are requiered) 
        - if you brick your Wii-U with NO NETWORK AVAILABLE (so you can't start FTP) : restore only the files 
          needed (partial backup ones) to get WiiuFtpServer working again (then unbrick as the usual way)

2021/12/08 V7-0 :    
    > dived further in the code and rework the original sources (ftpiiu) to :
        - complete the work left (TODO) that essentially fix the limitation to one upload slot (vrt_chdir failure in ftp_MKD)
        - now server allows 6 simultaneous transfers on both ways (UL/DL)
        - add a transfer file module (asynchronous calls safe) to handle files transfering
        - add IO optimization on file (using a user buffer, socket one already implemented)
        - transfer speeds now are over 3MB/s in both ways (UL/DL)
    > set rights to 644 (instead of 666)
    > externalize dependencies (libIOSUHAX from yaWut and WUT library)
    > add a 2 level log file saved on the SDcard (disable by default if you compile sources because it impacts server performance)

    > rewrite send_from_file() and recv_to_file() for non blocking mode and chunk transfert (per block)
    > pre-allocate a transfer buffer of 50MB per connection
        - this chunk size ensure that the app does not reache the max RAM available when transfering 8 files simultaneously
        - this buffer is used by both mode (download/upload)
        - it result in a faster transfer rate and mostly faster open/close times for connections
