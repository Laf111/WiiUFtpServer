FTP server based on libWUT and libIOSUHAX.
Works with MOCHA and HAXCHI.

It fixes remaining files injection failures when using ftp-everywhere (such as saves for WWHD*).
The performance (bandwidth) of the server is close to be doubled compared to ftpiiU based on dynamics libs.

Comes with all necessary files (emebeded libWut and compile sources of libIOSUHAX). 
No dependencies to set.

The build process creates : HBL app + WUP package (to install it on the Wii-U menu as a channel)

* Few games such as WWHD check the save files'rights and refuse to import them if permissions rights are not set using IOSUHAX_FSA_ChangeMode.

2021/04/22 V1-1 : 
    > change rights on the files received : fix files injection (saves for WWD for example)
    > Increase bandwith 20% more (close to 50% gain compared to ftp-everywhere)

    
    
TODO : 

> patch version in "_sdCard\wiiu\apps\WiiUFtpServer\meta.xml" on build
