FTP server based on libWUT and libIOSUHAX. 
It fixes remaining files injection failures when using ftp-everywhere (such as saves for WWHD*).
The performance (bandwidth) of the server is doubled (using WUT+FTP buffers increased).

Comes with all necessary files (emebeded libWut and compile sources of libIOSUHAX). 
No dependencies to set.

The build process creates : HBL app + WUP package (to install it on the Wii-U menu as a channel)

* Few games such as WWHD check the save files'rights and refuse to import them if permissions rights are not set using IOSUHAX_FSA_ChangeMode.

TODO : fix wrong files timestamps (set to OS GMT time for display purpose instead of J1970 in ftpiiU)
======================================================================================================
BUILD : (i used Windows)

Install devkitPro (in DEVKITPRO_PATH)
Launch "msys2\msys2_shell.bat"
export DEVKITPRO=$DEVKITPRO_PATH
cd WiiUFtpServer
./build.sh

      time_t seems to be a long double timestamp with micro-seconds based on epoch 1980
      The following code return "floating-point type"
        if ((time_t)-1 > 0) {
            // time_t is an unsigned type
        }
        else if ((time_t)1 / 2 > 0) {
            // time_t is a signed integer type
        }
        else {
            // time_t is a floating-point type (I've never seen this)
        }

2021/05/28 V3-2 : Enhance display log on server side, multithreading just for the fun... (bottleneck is on network socket not on CPU), 
                  a real progress should be a SSL server using lib curl (should be more efficient than using select() for FTP sockets as 
                  the code is already asynchronous I/O)
    > remove unecessary characters from the logged line (shorter the line)
    > use default thread on CPU2 for the ftp serveur (priority 1)
    > set network connections on CPU0 (priority 0)
    > main process is launched (as usual) on the default thread of CPU1
